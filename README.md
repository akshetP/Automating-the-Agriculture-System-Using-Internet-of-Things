# Automating-the-Agriculture-System-Using-Internet-of-Things
A Smart Agriculture System to analyse the physical parameters of the farm in real-time and taking an informed decision on whether to water the farm or no based on this data using IoT technologies. I have used the MQTT Protocol to transfer the data over the internet, the microcontroller used is NodeMCU with the ESP8266 Chip. The concepts required to create this project are taught and explained really well by [Mr Shrey Sharma.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmashrey48/) on [his youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQMqxNnYvxUZTvXljpBrZqA)
